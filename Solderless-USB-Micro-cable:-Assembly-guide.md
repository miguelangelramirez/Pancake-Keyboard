**Estimated assembly time:** 30 mins

### You will need:

* Solderless USB Micro cable kit 
* Cigarette lighter
* Scissors
* Sharp knife
* Long nose pliers
* Heat gun

### Kit contents:

![Solderless USB Micro Kit](https://i.imgur.com/EsYBOai.jpg)
 Check that you have all the parts.

* 2x 5mm Ø heatshrink
* 10mm Ø heatshrink
* 7mm Ø heatshrink
* USB-A solderless connector
* USB-A metal jacket
* USB Micro solderless connector
* USB Micro jacket lower
* USB Micro jacket upper
* 1.5 meters 4-strand shielded cable
* 1.6 meters paracord

Note: You can customize your cable by using any 550 pound, 7 strand paracord which comes in many colours and patterns.

# 1.

![Singe the ends of the paracord](https://i.imgur.com/VnEdsZK.jpg)
Cut the ends of the paracord with scissors to neaten them up and lightly singe the ends with a cigarette lighter to prevent them from fraying.

# 2.

![Inch the paracord over the cable](https://i.imgur.com/Ka2JsAm.jpg)
Insert the cable into the end of the paracord then inch the cable slowly through. Feed the paracord over the cable end a few centimeters at a time, then push the cord down the cable. This step may take some time.

# 3.

![Cut the paracord to length](https://i.imgur.com/VTImBkG.jpg)
Cut the paracord to length so that the ends are about 10mm from the ends of the cable when stretched out. Then feed the 5mm Ø heatshrink over the ends.

# 4.

![Strip the ends of the cable](https://i.imgur.com/9tjSnUq.jpg)
Strip about 7mm from the ends of the cable.

# 5.

![Separate the shielding from the wires](https://i.imgur.com/qPgGBA2.jpg)
Separate the shielding from the wires.

# 6.

![Twist the shielding together and splay the wires](https://i.imgur.com/BGRA6KR.jpg)
Twist the shielding together and splay the wires. You will need to arrange the wires in order as shown, (Red - White - Yellow - Black) then cut them so that the ends are even.

# 7.

Feed the metal USB-A jacket onto the cable.

# 8.

![Wiggle the wires into the solderless USB-A connector](https://i.imgur.com/VQP8hxo.jpg)
Wiggle the wires into the solderless USB-A connector. Take note of the orientation of the connector. Make sure that the wires go evenly and deeply into the connector. Make sure that the wires are still in the same order (Red - White - Yellow - Black) as described in step 6.

# 9.

![Squeeze the connector together tightly](https://i.imgur.com/3TeUjyU.jpg)
Squeeze the USB-A connector together tightly.

# 10.

![Push the metal jacket over the connector](https://i.imgur.com/hVKrgbG.jpg)
Push the metal jacket over the connector. Take note of the orientation of the metal jacket and the connector. Push it all the way in until the end of the connector is flush with the end of the metal jacket.

# 11.

![Fold the metal arms around the cable with the long nose pliers](https://i.imgur.com/xcf3hyZ.jpg)
Carefully fold the metal arms around the cable with the long nose pliers one at a time.

# 12.

![Push the paracord and heatshrink up to the metal jacket](https://i.imgur.com/RQPVF9j.jpg)
Push the paracord and heatshrink up to the metal jacket then use the heat gun to activate the heatshrink. Be careful not to overheat the paracord as it can melt.

# 13.

![Feed the 10mm dia heatshrink over the jacket](https://i.imgur.com/XbcxRgN.jpg)
Feed the 10mm dia heatshrink over the jacket and shrink it with the heat gun.

# 14.

![Prepare the other end of the cable](https://i.imgur.com/owlSv0S.jpg)
Prepare the other end of the cable using the same method as described in steps 4, 5, and 6.

# 15.

![Open out the holes slightly](https://i.imgur.com/koEtMJ0.jpg)
You will need to open out the holes slightly by gently inserting a knife tip into the opening.

# 16.

![Wiggle the wires deep into the holes](https://i.imgur.com/NXgG85z.jpg)
Wiggle the wires deep into the holes.
